## Frontend Dependencies

This project uses a variety of libraries and tools to manage the front-end, handle forms, manage state, and integrate with external services. Below is an explanation of each dependency used in the project.

### Main Packages

- **React (`react`, `react-dom`)**: The core libraries for building the user interface using components and rendering them in the browser.
- **react-scripts**: Scripts and configuration used by Create React App to handle development, testing, and building the project.
- **react-router-dom**: Provides routing capabilities, allowing navigation between different pages and components within the application.

### UI and Styling

- **@mui/material, @mui/icons-material**: Material-UI (MUI) is a popular React component library that provides pre-designed, customizable components and icons for building responsive interfaces.
- **@emotion/react, @emotion/styled**: Used with Material-UI to enable CSS-in-JS, allowing you to write CSS styles directly in JavaScript and apply them to React components.
- **bootstrap, react-bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a widely used CSS framework, while `react-bootstrap` integrates Bootstrap components into React as reusable components.
- **bootstrap-icons**: Provides icons that follow the Bootstrap style.
- **slick-carousel, react-slick**: Used for creating carousels or sliders, enabling the display of items (like images or cards) in a scrollable view.
- **swiper**: Another library for creating touch-friendly carousels and sliders.

### Form Handling and Validation

- **formik**: A library that simplifies form handling in React, helping manage form state, validation, and submission.
- **react-hook-form**: Another form handling library that focuses on minimal re-renders and simplicity. It integrates well with various validation libraries.
- **yup**: Used with `formik` and `react-hook-form` for form validation, allowing you to define schema-based validations.

### Data Fetching and HTTP Requests

- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests, allowing you to interact with external data sources and APIs.

### Notifications and User Feedback

- **react-toastify**: A library for displaying customizable toast notifications, useful for alerting users to success, error, or informational messages.

### PDF Generation

- **jspdf**: A library that allows you to generate PDF documents programmatically, useful for exporting information like prescriptions or reports.

### Icons

- **react-icons**: Provides access to various popular icon libraries directly in React components, enabling you to easily add icons to your UI.

### Miscellaneous

- **lineicons**: Another icon set used to provide additional icon styles.
- **reactstrap**: A library that provides Bootstrap 4 components for React, enabling easier UI development using familiar Bootstrap styles.

### Testing

- **@testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event**: These libraries provide utilities for testing React components, simulating user interactions, and checking DOM output in tests.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-appointment.git
cd doctor-appointment
npm install
npm start
```

## Backend API (DotNet)

This API is built with ASP.NET Core to manage doctor appointments, including authentication and role-based authorization for admins, doctors, and patients.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT Bearer authentication with role-based authorization policies (`AdminOnly`, `DoctorOnly`, `PatientOnly`).
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration**: API documentation and testing UI using Swagger, with JWT authentication supported in the UI.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Database interaction is managed using Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server connection.
- **CORS Policy**: Configured CORS policy to allow requests from any origin, method, and header, ensuring API accessibility.
- **Dependency Injection**: Repositories and services (`IDoctorRepository`, `JwtService`) are injected into the application using ASP.NET Core's dependency injection.
- **JSON Serialization**: The API uses `ReferenceHandler.Preserve` to handle circular references in JSON responses.
- **HTTPS Redirection**: Enforces secure communication by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Swagger JWT Setup**: Configured Swagger UI to allow testing authenticated endpoints using JWT tokens.

## Installation and Setup

To run this API locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-appointment-api.git
cd doctor-appointment-api
dotnet restore
